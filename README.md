## Windows ü™ü
  
This bot was originally created to run on a Raspberry Pi that hosts my SpeedTracker instance, but it can also run on a Windows machine. Follow these steps to get the bot up and running on Windows.

1. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Discord bot token, Discord account ID and Speedtest Tracker details:

   ```env
   BEARER_TOKEN=your_bearer_token
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
   DISCORD_ID=your_discord_account_id
   SERVER_IP=your_server_ip
   SERVER_PORT=your_server_port

2. Simply run the bot.bat file located in the root directory!

## Raspberry Pi üêß | Running as a Service

Here's the cool setup! I have this bot running as a service on my Raspberry Pi. If you're a Raspberry Pi user, this should be a breeze (:

1. Copy the provided service file to the systemd directory:

   ```sh
   sudo cp service/speedtesttrackerbot.service /etc/systemd/system/speedtesttrackerbot.service

2. Edit the file at /etc/systemd/system/speedtesttrackerbot.service. 

   - Line 10; replace /path/to/your/project with the actual path to your bot's main file.
   - Line 13: replace /path/to/your/project with the actual path to your project directory.
   - Lines 17, 18, 19, 20, 21: Replace everything inside quotes with their respective values.
   - Lines 23: Make sure to replace with the correct user.

3. Reload systemd to apply changes:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload

4. Enable and start the service:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl start speedtesttrackerbot
   sudo systemctl enable speedtesttrackerbot

5. The bot should now be running as long as you followed the steps correctly (:
